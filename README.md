# Modulo
 
Modulo is a game created by a team of 3 including me during our second semester at DigiPen. My main role on the team was to work on the gameplay, scripting and audio systems in the game. We created a custom engine and the game runs on it. My role also revolved around streamlining various pipelines in the game. 

**Unzip the two lib files to run the visual studio project**
